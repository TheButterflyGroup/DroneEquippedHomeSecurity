# DroneEquippedHomeSecurity

Home security system that can activate a drone when it detects an intruder. Our hypothesis is that having a drone lift of will deter intruders. Having a drone would also reduce the number of cameras needed in a home or warehouse security setting. In the future, we would like to include the capability to take photos or records video when the drone activates. Also, Wwe built a small wooden door on-site and attached a sensor to it to simulate a door being open and closed to test the drone.

## Built With

CSS3
HTML5
MEAN Stack
Parrot Drone
Passport.js
Photon Core
Rapberry Pi
Socket.io

- [x] Display history or sensors that were activated



### Next Steps

Features that you would like to add at some point in the future.

- [ ] Allow a user to turn the security system on / off
- [ ] Improve the user dashboard
- [ ] Make the drone more intelligent and able to move to specific locations on the premises (house, warehouse etc.) based on the sensor that was activated.
